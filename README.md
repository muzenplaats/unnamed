# unnamed v1.3.5rc
You and me are the same in freedom whilst you and I are individuals for the liberty.

## Icon
```
人人 = 民(2人) = 仁
```
It is beautiful when people are kind in a village.


## Slogan
A human and another are two kind people.


## Introduction

Lambda ::= 人(human)

Comments,
```
(3人) == (人人人) => 乑 = 眾(crowd)`.
```
The above is a temporary recognition between human, people and the
crowd. Currently, this repository is private but not public.

## Usage
The langualge is called subject-object programing. The main idea
hidden is called the reflection theorem. Programmers do not worry
about it yet. Currently, we mimic it in

```(reflection theorem)
sub-obj, sub~obj,
sub->obj, sub<-obj, sub~>obj, sub<~obj,
sub=>obj, sub<=obj,sub>=obj, sub=<obj,
*sub<->obj*, sub=obj, sub==obj, sub===obj,
sub&obj, sub&&obj, sub|obj, sub||obj, !sub, !obj,
sub!=objand sub!==obj,
```

In witch *sub<->obj* is the starting point for the thinkers in
the reflection theorem.

Please refer to macro template in `./src/hello-world.sop` for your
starting plate. The usage here is in lang="sop-test" in which
it has wider domain range in langualge for testing purposes.

The language `sop` is currently unstable, and for `sop-test` it is
not stable. Please start with it in lang="sop" quick as
illustrated withou only subjects in, I, you, she, he and objects in
me, myself, you, yourself, yourselves, her, him.
Feel free to try my, your, her and his in.
We do not put they, their and them in to simplify the process.
For your starting point, it is only you and I now.
Please refer to `./src/hello-world.sop` The time is free and
I will discuss with the producer about them time. It is either
an exercise or a pratice for you.
It is a starting plate. It is not a test for the language.
What we want to do it for your/our jobs now.
The language is free in `sop-test` without limitaion.

```sop-test
|| the-title.sop  || subject-object programing
|| the-description
|| Program (something)
[>]
  do-something
  do-this
  do-that
  whatever
  || (pause)
  || halt? stale?
  halt(something)?
  stale(something)?

  [||] Pause for scripting
    || The description of something is wrong.
    || Todos..
    || ..
    || ..
    || to be back in the program
  [>] Resume the program

  lamda $ = $(something)
  return $ <- the-lambda-value
[[$]]

And do it in the CRUTRI loop,
[Compile]
[Run]
[Undo]
[Test]
[Revision]
[Interpretation of $]
```

The subject-object programing has been tested, and it is still to be
tested. The language is currently *unstable*, in `lang=sop-test`.


## Hints for the users
- Make your decisions.
- Perhaps I have an intension from the insperation.
- Maybe I have the attension for the asperation.


## Milestones
- 2022-03-03_04 Acupunture for weak patients
- 2022-03-04_05 A global conference for the liberty

## Development
The codename is `nature`. Currently, the project is 'Hello World' for the beginners.
The programming language C++ is chosen because it is mainly a backend project and
C++ is highly portable in the major operating systems.

**Install**
```sh
cd ~/Development
git clone https://github.com/muzenplaats/unnamed.git
```

**Run (backend) **
```sh
cd unnamed/src
make
cd ../build
./main  # Hello World!
```

In Windows operating systems, it can be run in [Dev-C++](https://www.bloodshed.net/)
(integrated development environment, IDE),
[MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) (command line),
or other alternatives.

**For front-end developers**
```sh
cd unnamed/src/frontend
# It is open here.
```
