Please moderately eat and drink something. Remove some solid and liquid wastes to the toilet. Feel comfortable to come back for the practice. For half an hour time, please come back for the practice. Questions? If you wanted or if you want..

Questions? The description will be in Chinese with a few translation in English. Q: A: It really depends on you for your resistance. I changed my mind. We will do it an hour later from now. Q: A: The practitioners will follow me by their knowledge and expertise. If the practitioner did not want to follow me, you are excluded. Q: A: You will feel strong for some while as of a therapy. Q: No. An hour for you to be comfortable now. If you ate or drank, do not be full. Make 20%-30% discount will be good. Please go to the loo before coming back.

Please come back in an hour. For your fresh acupuncture, you will feel some drilling, slightly achy, itching or titillating. I will write something in Chinese now and you do not worry.

勿作過多嘗試，以免誤入死穴！
請同時作自我了解、論述，要精深、全面。以便日後再學或與同行切磋。
腎經以湧泉、然谷二穴。

One hour for you to feel comfortable for the practice. Now. If you felt something as aforementioned feelings or others, please respond to your practitioner and he/she will adjust it for you to make you comfortable. Itchy is a good sense for here. You can travel to there if you have time.

It is about time for our practices. The practitioner will do some small talk with you. You can be hesitant now. You will feel difficult for the first pin and you should respond it to the practitioner. Shall we start it with small talks now.

Okay, we have reached a certain agreement. If you have started, please continue. If you have not do it yet, the idea is like that. The practitioner try it, but not try-and-error! The patient feels that I am tested. If you have any feelings such as uncomfortable, please immediately tell the practitioner and he/she will try another position. The first success is that you feel itching. Then follow your own feelings and thoughts. You may want to ask questions to the practitioner. He/she shall be happy to answer your questions.

The practitioner will make you feel ready. Please start it. The keyword for this particular practice is to do it forward. If you felt that it was against one’s feelings or thoughts, the practitioner have to reconsider your procedure. Because it might kill you! Don’t worry, take it easy and you will know how to do it.

Imagine that the pin is strong for you to help your weak points. If the strong pin reached your strong point, you may want to reject it.

Consider that a pin making you itchy, as a magnetic dipole moment. The pin interact the moment by conducting the magnetic field with the ambience. It may be possible that you don’t feel anything but it still reacts. You feel safe and please follow your practitioner.

An easy idea is to put your phone down when you are comfortable and grab it to ask questions when you fear it. We are not alone but we are together. For example, do some messenger, FaceTime, what’s app, line or WeChat are allowed here. Avoid to do it in the social media such as Facebook, and also avoid news for the time being. If there would be important news for you, your accompany will let you know and please discuss how to do it with the practitioner for the sake of your health.

We are safe now. The next thing for the practitioner is to guide the chi(magnetic fields) in the twelve passages with the miner networks. When you feel the field is forward, and the fields are forwarding, it is about to finish the針and move forward to 炙. Please still react with the practitioner and follow his/her instruction.

It is about time to 起針, and think about where to put the 草炙. Please do it in your way because it is fine now.

I think that we are doing fine. Please follow your practitioner and I think that you can go home soon.

Some topics and subjects have been taken home. My prescription was not always correct but it guided us toward a good direction. The doctors who have the expertise could correct me. We were in match and I have also built up the trust between the patients. So that I have the courage and confidence to guide us in this practice. As I mentioned, it was a particular practice. Your possible future practice shall be different. Not only here about acupuncture, your direction is go for your trusted (practitioner; your some), or ask for the reputation.

Say,
The reputation is appealing to me.
I am attractive by his/her personal quality.
You may go either direction, and/or both in your course(s).

Focus on your topic, topic(s) and topics. It is a way long for us. I can only do a little bit. Why could I do it? Because I like to learn, to learn it. For my life, I can either get it or I can learn it. There are too many things to learn and I do not want to make myself exhausted. My problem is that I have a greedy heart. That was told by the nurse in the psychiatric hospital in the Netherlands. You have a greedy heart.

I learn how to reduce my greedy heart in Buddhism. We are ill in three manners: greed, irate and ignorance. The Dharma instructs us to convert the three to commandment, calm and wisdom, respectively.

## Brief summary:

- I am not ignorant; however my ignorance is still endless. (Translated from dharma:無無明亦無無明盡)

Please you can drink some water now. Only water in your favor temperature, and I will do a short meditation with you. Now, please..
If available, take a few to eat and make yourself comfortable. You can drink something else now. Avoid coffee, tea, cock, or so because they will stimulate you. We don’t want it now.

Please take your time. Some small talk will be good. You have your full feelings (sensation) of your body now. You slightly enter your psychological feelings now by yourself or yourselves.
Then I guide you now to your anger.

Please first reference the point that it irritates me, and second, it annoys me. If you could not write it down now, please ask your accompany to do it for you. Is it okay for you? Yes.
You are still in the acupuncture therapy now. Please follow your practitioner and the meditation is minor for your mental and physical balance. Please follow him/her now.
And then we take a short <br> now. In the <br>, you feed a line with a carriage return.

You or your accompany have prepared to record something for you. Do you feel alright about this? If not, please rearrange it to your secret level. Possible? Some not so please keep some of your anger feelings to yourself because you don’t want to share it by now. Do you feel it okay? OK.

In here, the recorders will not only hear the patient’s anger level but also observe his/her body language and log it.
I have finished walking with God. I will take my cigarettes break, and then we will start the meditation. Please make yourself comfortable and remember that you first listen to the practitioner and second the meditation from me.

To drink is okay in this meditation but avoid to eat. You can eat and avoid to eat because it will affect your psychological feelings and we don’t want it now.
My <br>.
The practitioner takes it over here.

## A short meditation of anger
(Note that it turned out to be long due to many more participants.)

He or she showed me a O, and later on, I figured it out that he/she meant X, and I am very angry at him/her.
I am very angry at this one.
I learned that it was because of them.
I noticed that you are not angry now.

(Peace)

I am angry, very angry from nowhere. No where or now here.
You are still not angry!!!
The scope is limited to your lover or loves now. Targeting one or ones now. Can you do it? We do some preparation.
First, close your eyes for half a minute now. And open now. Half-closed-half-open your eyes and you feel moderate illumination. Reduce the blinks of your eyes.
I am angry at this one or these ones now.
I am angry at you.
Because (to be recorded by your accompany or yourself.)
I hate you!!
I really hate you!

I told you that many times and you never wanted to listen to me!
I want to break up with you! (You one or ones can float because you want to find your anger source now.)
A print for your palms: thumb tip to tip. Touch your belly button. Other fingers touch the same fingers from both left and right. In )) -like :)) in u\n. Can you read it? Hold one; hold another. Hold each other. Thumb to thumb in left or right. It is called a health print.
You want to be angry now!!

He/she called me. We talked to each other happily. He/she wants to know something from me. I don’t want to tell him/her. He/she uses a word to hurt me now. I am very angry and hang up the phone.
I am still angry and I am thinking to call her back because I love him/her. But I am angry.
He/she calls me back because he/she loves me. Say sorry, you are not that word.
It was anger there but lovely.

You and I are normally okay but sometimes not. It is for our liberty.
We have partial liberty and partially in enemy mode. It will not change. It is always here from the west to the east and from the ancient time till now. It is not until.

I am angry. I like him/her. I try to be kind to him/her. I accumulate my anger to myself. Many and many, theybecome my Devil.
From time to time, I release part of my Devil due to my sanity. You drive me crazy. Because I like him/her. I will kill you, with loves. You are sweet, the west. In the east, our anger is different.
We have gone so far. I feel that we still want to learn each other. I am not a Lucy.

In Chinese, it has been promoted by Motz about 4-5BC ago: to love evenly, not to initiate fighting, economic usage and limited funeral.
I can say, I love you, evenly.
He has his theory book. There were hundreds of different kind of theory books from about 3-6BC in China. I don’t promote you to read them.

I promote our theory books, which are the ten books plus ten books currently. We read them as a novel, science fiction, essays, poems and so on, and we can read it fluently. The reality is not really matter there. The value shall be spread by the books.
However, we are doing, acting or so now. We want the reality. Sometimes, we owe the fact because we don’t know the reality, and it is called the de-facto.

I failed to make you angry in this meditation.

My idea is that sometimes I do anger instantaneously whilst other times I act the anger spontaneously.
I could not succeed to trigger your anger here.
Do you have questions for me?

Can you do it by yourself now because we want to record something about your anger for this meditation?
Try it and do not test. You will be more easy to get angry by trying.
Some of you don’t want to do it and this is a hint for you to go out of this meditation.
Some still in; others are out now. All of you are still cared by your practitioner.

You try to annoy one or annoy yourself.
For the intensity purposes, please some try to irritate someone or irritate yourself. In testing purposes, can you easily be irritated. The data is for now but not for other time. But they are related.

The above (41) is a question during my job application process. The human resource does want to know this information. At that time, I felt yes but I answered no. For now, I changed. I feel that your prison for me helped me to change my behavior.

By the way, I encourage you to submit your sections and/or chapters to the organization for our book series. You might have found out that some of them did not fit in the context. And they will be in a note or in the references. It is typical in the ancient Chinese novels.
Still in the anger mode now for your self-study.

(Aside) For composition fanciers, in preface, prelude, prologue and foreword. For CS language composition fanciers in pragma.
The second hint: If you did not feel weak or even felt strong, it is a chance for you to leave the meditation now.

The third hint: If you felt like to have sex with your mate, you shall go out of the meditation now. The reason is simple. If you were weak, you don’t want to have sex.

Question: John and Marry had a quarrel. After that they make ____. Fill the blank. The correct answer for me was clear. To make up. I am still confusing now. However, you can make love after that.

I don’t have your context now because your cases vary. If you trust your practitioner now, it is a hint for you to leave the meditation. You can come back if you want to. You go out now if you were satisfied by your self-observation with your records.

The left are about in anger now. Review it by yourself with your records. The practitioner helps you here for a moment. He/she only concern your body but not your mood. You don’t ask him/her to help about your affairs.

I think that it is difficult for you. I don’t know how to help you. Are you a couple? Yes. Is someone alone? Yes. We try to play the same game.

How to play the game? You have affair with her, my best friend, yesterday. I saw it. Do you regret? If no, You should calm down and let go. The anger will disappear by time with sorry feelings. He does not deserve you! You can leave now.

It is still a game. Please do not misunderstand me. If yes, we try to play a trade-off. You give me a ticket written that you will wash dishes for a month for me. Can you take this as an example. Because you did not want to make love, so that you try to make it up now. Are you okay with this trading game? Try and there will not be an error. There will be many mistakes perhaps. The mistakes are for your tolerance. Can you do this now? The keyword is make-up such as your cosmetics. I ask all of you. If you were alone, you give the ticket to yourself. If you were more than two, the tickets shall go more complicated. It is doable.

I don’t ask you here now. You try it. If you could not do it, you will come back here. We are still here.

Hints: if you felt like a game, you are likely to leave here.
(I thought that it is a short meditation because I felt that only small amounts of people are here. It takes long. Don’t worry! We will do it.)

I see it in two-fold now. One is happy about the tickets; another is in the obstacle. Please continue it for a while.

For the rest of you, we introduce contracts here. For example, you are not divorced by the courts but you make contacts by yourselves (some in yourself as well). He betrayed me. In the contract, he cannot see our son for three months. As an example. Please do it and we will see what is left. Questions? Not now.

For the left of you, we do it in compromise. To do it, we give both sides in the same tolerance. For example, we have done a lot of efforts and we just could not make it. It is a pity that we break up now.??

We do the same tolerance in 5w-1h evenly. For example, we will do similar things as now later in a month. The content level will be increased or raised. I started it with when as an example, can you continue the 5w-1h anyhow? Please answer me now. It is the end of the meditation.

I don’t know clearly the keyword now. Perhaps begin with the current tickets and contracts.
(I’ll go home now.)

I think that it went pretty good. Can I ask you to do me a favor? If your same tolerance was (-1 +1), can you make it (-1.2 +1.2) to make everyone happier? Because, for me, it looks more robust to me.
Y/N? Politics for example. USA? Yes; Russia? Yes; China? Yes; EU? Yes. Other countries, do anyone disagree the above world leading powers? No.

The question is for Ukraine now.
I ask the world leading powers. You resulted 5w-1h have to be agreed by Ukraine.
Therefore, I only ask President Putin, Russia. Can you make agreement of the 5w-1h with Ukraine in compromise? Please take your time.
You’ll see.. We leave the question here. If they could not agree, we think about it later. How about this arrangement? O.K.
We give the Ukraine issues the first priority. Others, such as Taiwan issues for lower ones. The Ukraine issues in priority and others in insurance. It could progress smoother. How do you think it?
Not quite.. How about replacing the word insurance to assurance? It is more closed to the reality. OK.
We have something about the compromise with tolerance now. This is the end of this meditation.

(Tick)

We take a rest such as for a meal. We will come back here again without the meditation mode. Because it might be changed. We hope it to be robust. We will meet each other again by the order of the current leader of the producer.

## For the leader
How to do it? My idea is in a conference with several chairmen to control the topics and subjects. How about your idea?

Agreed.

Then we need to think about:

The pairs of (session-name chairman);
How many sessions (how much time in total)?
?
Okay.

For the procedure, Ukraine is of importance. They will be in the first, last or other positions of the sessions. I have no idea now. How is your opinion? I have an idea: both the first and the last sessions are about Ukraine issues. The former the USA chair the latter the EU chair or vice versa. This or is weird.

You don’t need to confirm or reconfirm with me. You lead it and I do my best to help you.

For example, do you think that it is a conference or it is a test? My idea is only for your information. I think it in two-fold. One, it is serious for all the participants so that it is a conference. Another, for our production purposes it is a test. How do you think it or yours? Do you agree? ?

If you agreed, please inform all the participants this idea. This is what I mean by the responsibility.

I felt that you did not agree that it is a test for you. Is it correct? Yes. Therefore, please I’d like to ask you to reduce the testing feelings in your crew. Can you do it? Yes, great!

## ~~~~~~

I feel that you are ready for the opening of the conference, or it is ongoing? Ongoing. I wish you to inform them that it is a conference but not a test. The participants will know that it is really serious. Can you do it? Yes. Something like that..

If it went off-course, one of your tool is to remind them that they hold several tickets and contacts. They can be changed but they are the basement for this conference. Do you agree this point? You don’t answer me. FYI.

Just a reminder because you are not used to it yet. Normally, you have the plan A and plan B. After your consideration, you put the plan A + intersection(A, B) in the contract. There are still something left in the plan B. We have learned to put it in the but-booklet within the contract. This is a typical way in the Chinese contract. We feel that we fulfill it(the contract). Sorry, I feel again Dragana. I cannot be concentrated now. Please go ahead.

May I explain it to you again. The intersection(plan A, plan B) is not in the original plan A. I made you confused here. You add the intersection into the plan A. Is it clear what I mean?

i.e.,

Your contract A :=
     original contract A +
     part of contract B, which is the
     intersection(contract A, contract B)

Some got it but it is not clear for others, because it is *recursive*.

To translate it in easy English. We have the contract A. There are also something in the contract B. The A is in your pro while the B is in your cons. However, you want to add some value from B to A. So that something in B is grabbed to be put in A. Is it clear? Yes. We go back to the equation above. Thus, the original A is enlarged by the part of B. This part becomes the intersection of final A and B. In short, there was not an intersection of A and B originally. You make something from B in as A n B. The original A n B is phi. You fill part of B for A n B to the best of your knowledge. Do I make the point? Yes. Do you feel that your contract is as best as this? About..

However, the Chinese contract is contract A and contract B in (pros A B). Yours is about (pro A) + some of (cons B). We are clear now. Chinese try to learn the Western way while the Western try to learn the Chinese way. In Chinese, there is no cons in. We only have con, which is eliminated. I wish the Chinese learn from you. You have learned the but-booklet already but you have not experienced the value yet. In the Chinese court, we often deal with the but-booklet. We often ask true or false whilst you usually ask yes or no. Can you understand it now?

Some do understand it but most could not digest it yet. I give the floor back to the leader of the producer.

If you are confused, begin with ruling your confusion out by your constitution.

The issues might be found out in your *constitutions*. Condense the issues to be your problems. Try if you can solve the problems.

I ask the president of Ukraine. Do you understand what I mean by that? Yes. Can I give the floor to you? Y/,,Can President Putin, Russia agree to temporarily give the floor to the president of Ukraine? Yes. Hereby, I would like to give the floor to the president of Ukraine. He will mainly deal with the problems raised by, perhaps, conflict of the Ukraine Constitution and the Russia Constitution. Can you do it now? Herewith, I give the floor to the president of Ukraine. Somehow, someone may also want to give the floor to the president of Russia. Is it fair for the moment? Agreeable. (floor)

## ~~~~~~

For your information

There is a quick solution in plan and you may think about the analogy to a contract.

(the-plan rain-plan).

In Chinese, (pros the-plan rain-plan).
In the Western, (pro the-plan) and (cons rain-plan).

In Chinese way, we ask the sky for the rain, true or false.
In the Western way, we ask God for the rain, yes or no.

I acquire the information, can the current leader of the producer hold the conference by sessions with chairmen, respectively? Not now? Not now. Does the public want to enter the sessions? Before the answer, does the leader think that you need to adjust the agenda for the participation of the public? He/she is thinking now.
